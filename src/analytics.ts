Results should be interpreted as exploratory patterns rather than prescriptive guidance.`,

      primaryFinding:
        "Technical debt shows a moderate association with organizational agility (r = -0.347, n = 87). This suggests that accumulating technical debt is associated with reduced execution speed in technology ventures.",
      practicalImplication:
        "The observed association suggests entrepreneurs face a trade-off between short-term development speed and long-term organizational agility. Technical debt accumulation appears to create execution bottlenecks as ventures scale.",
      vcImplication:
        "Code quality metrics may provide additional due diligence signals about execution risk. Ventures with high technical debt may face scaling challenges that impact their ability to iterate and respond to market feedback.",
      entrepreneurialRecommendation:
        "Entrepreneurs should monitor technical debt accumulation as a leading indicator of execution constraints. Strategic debt can be acceptable during product-market fit discovery, but should be actively managed before scaling phases.",
      researchContribution:
        "This study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of technical debt patterns across a technology venture portfolio. The observed associations contribute to our understanding of operational factors in startup execution and provide a foundation for future causal research.",
      studyLimitations:
        "Key limitations include: (1) Cross-sectional associations cannot establish causality, (2) Funding amounts may not reflect true venture success, (3) Sample limited to open-source ventures, (4) Potential selection bias toward publicly visible startups, (5) Technical debt metrics may not capture all code quality dimensions. Results should be interpreted as exploratory patterns rather than prescriptive guidance.",
